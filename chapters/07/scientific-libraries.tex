Hope this day will come...

\section{What is a library, API, framework etc.?}
\subsection{Numerical Recipes and GSL}
\subsection{MPI: Message Passing Interface}
Message passing interface, widely known as \texttt{MPI}, is a programming interface for distributed 
memory workloads. One can basically send and receive bytes (messages) between processors in the 
\texttt{MPI} environment. Almost every major simulation packages takes advantage of \texttt{MPI}
for running large scale simulations over a network of distributed processors.

\subsection{CUDA}

\subsection{PETSc and Trillinos}

\section{Why is it important to use libraries?}

\section{How do libraries talk to executables?}
